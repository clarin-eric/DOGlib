It is based on:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>&Tau;he <a href=\"https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research\">CORD-19 dataset</a> released by the team of <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/\">Semantic Scholar</a><sup>1</sup> and</li>\n\t<li>&Tau;he curated data provided by the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/\">LitCovid hub</a><sup>2</sup>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These data have been cleaned and integrated with data from <a href=\"https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs\">COVID-19-TweetIDs</a> and from other sources (e.g., PMC). The result was dataset of&nbsp;542,876 unique articles along with relevant metadata (e.g., the underlying citation network). We utilized this dataset to produce, for each article, the values of the following impact measures:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em><strong>Influence:</strong></em> Citation-based measure reflecting the total impact of an article. This is based on the PageRank<sup>3</sup> network analysis method. In the context of citation networks, it estimates the importance of each article based on its centrality in the whole network. This measure was calculated using the PaperRanking (<a href=\"https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking\">https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking</a>) library<sup>4</sup>.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Influence_alt:</em></strong> Citation-based measure reflecting the total impact of an article. This is the Citation Count of each article, calculated based on the citation network between the articles contained in the BIP4COVID19 dataset.</li>\n\t<li><em><strong>Popularity:</strong></em> Citation-based measure reflecting the current impact of an article. This is based on the AttRank<sup>5</sup> citation network analysis method. Methods like PageRank are biased against recently published articles (new articles need time to receive their first citations). AttRank alleviates this problem incorporating an attention-based mechanism, akin to a time-restricted version of preferential attachment, to explicitly capture a researcher&#39;s preference to read papers which received a lot of attention recently. This is why it is more suitable to capture the current &quot;hype&quot; of an article.</li>\n\t<li><em><strong>Popularity alternative:</strong></em> An alternative citation-based measure reflecting the current impact of an article (this was the basic popularity measured provided by BIP4COVID19 until version 26). This is based on the RAM<sup>6</sup> citation network analysis method. Methods like PageRank are biased against recently published articles (new articles need time to receive their first citations). RAM alleviates this problem using an approach known as &quot;time-awareness&quot;. This is why it is more suitable to capture the current &quot;hype&quot; of an article. This measure was calculated using the PaperRanking (<a href=\"https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking\">https://github.com/diwis/PaperRanking</a>) library<sup>4</sup>.</li>\n\t<li><em><strong>Social Media Attention: </strong></em>The number of tweets related to this article. Relevant data were collected from the <a href=\"https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs\">COVID-19-TweetIDs</a> dataset. In this version, tweets between 27/3/22-2/4/22 have been considered from the previous dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We provide five CSV files, all containing the same information, however each having its entries ordered by a different impact measure. All CSV files are tab separated and have the same columns (PubMed_id, PMC_id, DOI, influence_score, popularity_alt_score, popularity score, influence_alt score, tweets count).</p>\n\n<p>The work is based on the following publications:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n\t<li>COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). 2020.
