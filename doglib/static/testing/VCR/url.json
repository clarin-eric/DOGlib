The CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard. In Proceedings of the CLARIN Annual Conference, Aix-en-Provence, France.</Label><Description>The CLARIN infrastructure gives users access to an increasingly rich set of language-related re- sources, using the Virtual Language Observatory, the Federated Content Search, and the Virtual Collection Registry. While there is ample support for searching resources using metadata-based search, or full-text search, or aggregating resources into virtual collections, there is little support for users to help them processing resources in one way or another. While there is a consider- able number of processing software in the CLARIN world, there is no single point of access where users can find tools to fit their needs and the resource they have. In this paper, we present the CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard (LRS), which aims at helping users to connect resources with the tools that can process them. The LRS lists all applicable tools for a given resource, lists the tasks the tools can achieve, and invokes the selected tool in such a way so that processing can start immediately without any or little prior tool parameterization.</Description></Resource><Resource ref="r678"><Label>Zinn, C. 2018. A Bridge from EUDAT’s B2DROP cloud service to CLARIN’s Language Resource Switchboard. Linköping Electronic Press, (147):36–45.</Label><Description>The Language Resource Switchboard is becoming a central pillar in the CLARIN infrastruc- ture as it helps researchers to connect resources with tools that can process them in one way or another. Languages resources can be found in different places, and ideally, the switchboard is available nearby. Resources located at users’ desktop computers can simply be uploaded to the switchboard, and resources found in CLARIN’s Virtual Language Observatory can simply be sent to the switchboard by a simple click. Until now, the switchboard was only indirectly accessible for resources stored in the cloud. Here, users had to download a resource from their cloud storage to their desktop device before uploading it again to the switchboard to find appli- cable tools, which is tedious. In this paper, we describe how we linked EUDAT’s B2DROP cloud service to the switchboard, giving users the capability to directly launch the switchboard with a resource from their B2DROP account. Also, we describe the usage of B2DROP to support the switchboard’s back-end for intermediate file storage. The reported work makes a link to another infrastructure, and hence, facilitates and promotes the provision of complementary services to CLARIN members. We believe the cooperation between CLARIN and EUDAT to be of mutual benefit. On the one hand, our bridge makes the use of the generic cloud storage service from EUDAT more attractive to CLARIN members so that they are encouraged to use B2DROP rather than another cloud provider. On the other hand, it encourages EUDAT users to try out and profit from the CLARIN tool space, which in turn will challenge the tool providers to cope with an increased demand, and potentially new user requirements.</Description></Resource><Resource ref="r679"><Label>Zinn, C. 2018. The Language Resource Switchboard. Computational Linguistics, 44(4), pages 631-639, December 2018.</Label><Description>The CLARIN research infrastructure gives users access to an increasingly rich and diverse set of language-related resources and tools. Whereas there is ample support for searching resources using metadata-based search, or full-text search, or for aggregating resources into virtual col- lections, there is little support for users to help them process resources in one way or another. In spite of the large number of tools that process texts in many different languages, there is no single point of access where users can find tools to fit their needs and the resources they have. In this squib, we present the Language Resource Switchboard (LRS), which helps users to discover tools that can process their resources. For this, the LRS identifies all applicable tools for a given resource, lists the tasks the tools can achieve, and invokes the selected tool in such a way so that processing can start immediately with little or no prior tool parameterization.</Description></Resource></VirtualCollection></Components></CMD>
